v annotation display for multiple timestamps

Technical summary of the requirements for your annotation display logic:

annotations function called regularly. It checks if there is a current annotation being displayed; if there is, it checks if it has finished its display duration. If it has, it sets the current annotation to nil and calls findNextAnnotation() to find the next annotation. if it hasn't finished its display duration, it does nothing and returns. if the current annotation is nil, because the program recently started, or the prior annotation has finished its calculated display duration, it calls findNextAnnotation() to find the next annotation. findnextannotation() finds the  annotations whose timestamps are ismaller than the current time and adds it to the annotation queue. when the current annotation has finished being displayed, it displays the annotation from the queue with the smallest timestamp first, setting the current time as the start time for that annotation and removing it from the queue. 5. This process repeats, ensuring that each annotation is displayed for its entire duration before moving to the next one, even if their timestamps overlap. If the current annotation finishes its display duration and the next annotation's timestamp has not been reached yet, no annotations are displayed until the next one's timestamp is reached.

Logic for Selecting the Correct Annotation Timestamp
Objective: To select the best timestamp for each annotation -  in a manner that ensures maximum spacing between each different annotation,  with only one timestamp chosen per annotation

Data Structure
Each annotation is represented by an object containing:
A unique identifier (ID).
An array of one or more timestamps.
Process Overview

Single vs. Multiple Timestamps:
Annotations with a single timestamp are straightforward; their single timestamp is selected.
Annotations with multiple timestamps require a selection process to determine the optimal timestamp.

 Approach:
The goal is to select timestamps that maximize the minimum distance between any two annotations.
This ensures annotations are evenly distributed throughout the song and not clustered.
For annotations with multiple timestamps, all possible combinations of timestamps are considered.
Each combination represents a potential distribution of annotations across time.

Selecting the Best Combination:
For each combination, calculate the minimum distance between any two different annotations.
The combination with the largest minimum distance is selected as it represents the most spread-out arrangement.
This is an exhaustive approach that ensures the best distribution is chosen.




displacing one annotation from a densely clumped cluster to a different part of the song lacking nearby annotations is a practical solution for cases where adjusting within the cluster isn't sufficient. This approach respects the limit on adjustment range and helps in maintaining overall readability and contextual relevance.  modify the adjustment function to include a step where, if adjusting within a cluster doesn't adequately spread out the annotations, the annotation with the lowest similarity score in the cluster is moved to a different, less crowded part of the song. 





Handling Identical Timestamps:
In cases where multiple annotations have identical timestamps, these are treated as distinct entities in the combinatorial analysis.
The algorithm can handle such scenarios without any issues.



I need you to list out the annotations and their chosen timestamps.

For each annotation with multiple timestamps, select one that maximizes the minimum distance between this 
annotation and all other annotations already added to the queue. This ensures that annotations are evenly spread 
throughout the song without creating cluttering or large gaps between them.
2. If an annotation has only a single timestamp available, add it directly into the queue at its given timestamp as 
it will not create any cluttering.
3. Make sure to consider all existing annotations and their proximity when making informed decisions on which 
timestamp from each annotation with multiple timestamps should be chosen for display.
